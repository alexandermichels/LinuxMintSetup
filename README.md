# Linux Mint Setup

### Introduction

This is Bash script to help me configure the Linux Mint computers I work on to have the applications and packages I like to use.

### Usage

You have to make sure you have an Android Studio ZIP, gitkraken.deb, jdk.tar.gz, and Netbeans.sh for all of this to execute. Also make sure that you update the filenames and paths in the Bash script.

### TODO

This is an always growing list as I expand the work I am doing and the tools I use. Once I find the time and motivation, I would like to find and save the specific configurations for each the applications mentioned also.
